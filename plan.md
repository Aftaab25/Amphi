- Audio Playback: Use a library like:
- PortAudio: Cross-platform audio library.
- SDL2: Provides robust multimedia features.
- Video Rendering:
    - Use OpenGL for cross-platform rendering.
    - Alternatively, use Vulkan or DirectX for specific platform optimizations.
- File Picker:
    - Use platform-specific libraries or a cross-platform GUI backend like ImGui File Dialog.
